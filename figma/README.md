# Figma Make – Canonical UI Source

All files in this directory are exported from Figma Make.

Rules:
- These files define the exact UI/UX.
- No redesign, simplification, or visual interpretation is allowed.
- App code must match these files exactly in layout, spacing, typography, colors, and states.
- If app code conflicts with figma files, figma files win.
- If something is unclear, ask before proceeding.
