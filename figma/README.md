# Figma Make – Source of Truth

This folder contains code exported directly from Figma Make.

Rules for implementation:
- Files in this folder represent the canonical UI/UX.
- Do NOT redesign, simplify, or optimize visuals.
- Do NOT change spacing, colors, typography, or layout.
- Use these files as reference, not inspiration.
- If there is a conflict between app code and these files, THESE FILES WIN.

Structure:
- /tokens → design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- /components → canonical UI components
- /screens → full page layouts
- /interactions → UX behavior and transitions
